CPPCast
=======

A C++/Qt implementation of the Chromecast based on Sebastian Mauer's Cheapcast.

This is a personal learning project and isn't intended to be used by anyone but me. It may never actually get finished or even to a working state.

This project makes use of the following libraries and frameworks:

* [Qt](http://qt-project.org/)
* [QtWebApp HTTP Server](http://stefanfrings.de/qtwebapp/index-en.html)
